          <p>
            Slam Dunk Contest is a two-round competition in which five judges 
            score every dunk on a scale of six to 10. 
            The highest score a dunk can receive is a 50 while a 30 is the lowest 
            possible score. All four contestants will get two dunks in the first round.

          <h3>3-Point Contest</h3>
          <p>
            In this contest, participants attempt to make as many three-point field 
            goals as possible from five positions behind the three-point line in one 
            minute. Players begin shooting from one corner of the court, and move from 
            station to station along the three-point arc until they reach the other 
            corner.

        no one can bother me.

      <h4>About Us</h4>
      <p>
        We learn to make a shell for ourselves when we are young and then spend the<br> rest
         of our lives hoping for someone to reach inside and touch us. 
         Just touch us—anything<br> more than that would be too much for us to bear.
